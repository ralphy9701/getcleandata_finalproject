The final tidy dataset contains 180 records, or 79 observations representing measurement averages for 30 subjects performing 6 activities.

subjectcode: The first column identifies the subject with labels from 1 to 30.
actname: The second column contains the description of the activity. The activities are:
- LAYING
- SITTING
- STANDING
- WALKING
- WALKING DOWNSTAIRS
- WALKING UPSTAIRS

Columns 3-81 are averages for each of the features contained in the study. These include:
